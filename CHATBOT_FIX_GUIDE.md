# Chatbot Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Server Error: "Route.get() requires a callback function but got a [object Object]"

**Problem**: The auth middleware was imported incorrectly in the chat routes.

**Solution**: Changed the import from:
```javascript
const auth = require('../middleware/auth');
```
to:
```javascript
const { auth } = require('../middleware/auth');
```

### 2. Client Error: 'react-scripts' is not recognized

**Problem**: react-scripts was missing from the client dependencies.

**Solution**: Added react-scripts to client/package.json and installed it.

## Manual Fix Steps

If the automatic fix doesn't work, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Fix Server Dependencies
```bash
npm install @google/generative-ai
```

### Step 2: Fix Client Dependencies
```bash
cd client
npm install react-scripts@^5.0.1
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Test Server
```bash
node test-chatbot.js
```

### Step 4: Start Application
```bash
npm run dev
```
